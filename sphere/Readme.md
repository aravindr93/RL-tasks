## Sphere Task

The environment consists of a sphere, four walls (elastic collisions), and ground friction forces. The task is to move the ball to a goal position (go-to-goal) and to make it move along a desired trajectory (say a circle).

Written in MuJoCo. Easiest way to simulate the environment and attempt the task is to install openAI gym, and add the environment to the list under mujoco.
